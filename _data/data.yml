patientAdvisory:
  description: Our patient advisory group (also known as the PAG) is made up of X women who have been prescribed hormone therapy for breast cancer. They have been, and continue to be, actively involved throughout the research programme, including developing design and content of the intervention, testing usability, advising on patient-facing materials, reviewing questionnaires, reviewing emerging findings, and contributing to dissemination. We also set up a Community of Interest, a group of 28 women who have previously had breast cancer and have been prescribed hormone therapy. They advise us on an ad hoc basis, via email, on a range of topics such as real-life hints and tips for dealing with side-effects, for inclusion on the HT&Me website.

aboutProject:
  description: "Cancer is a complex group of diseases that arise from the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. These cells can invade and destroy nearby healthy tissues and organs, as well as spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream or lymphatic system. There are over 100 different types of cancer, each with its own set of risk factors, symptoms, and treatment options. Despite significant progress in cancer research, it remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection, effective treatments, and continued research are crucial in the fight against cancer."

workstreams:
  - name: Intervention development & optimisation
    title: Workstream 1
    description:
      - Workstream 1 involved the design, development and optimisation of the HT&Me intervention. It was developed using an evidence-based and theory-informed approach with patient and public involvement (PPI) integral to all stages of design and development.
      - We conducted two optimisation sub-studies to collect feedback from users. Changes were made to improve the HT&Me intervention as a result of these. Preliminary data suggests the HT&Me intervention is acceptable and engaging to users. Workstream 1 is complete.
      - The diagram below provides an overview of the intervention development, design and optimisation process.

  - name: Feasibility study
    title: Workstream 2
    description: Workstream 2 used both quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the HT&Me intervention, and the future randomised controlled trial (Workstream 3). To do this, we have recruited X women prescribed hormone therapy for early breast cancer across 5 NHS sites in England to receive the HT&Me intervention for 8 weeks alongside their usual care. Women were asked to complete a questionnaire before they receive the intervention, and then another 8 weeks later.

  - name: Evaluation of intervention effectiveness in reducing poor adherence and improving HRQoL in pragmatic RCT
    title: Workstream 3
    description:
      - Workstream 3 will deliver a randomised control trial (RCT) with a parallel process evaluation. A total of 1460 eligible women will be randomised to receive either the HT&Me intervention alongside usual care, or usual care alone. We are investigating whether the HT&Me intervention improves adherence to hormone therapy and cancer-specific health-related quality of life. Women will be asked to complete questionnaires 6, 12 and 18-months after they have been randomised in the study, measuring their adherence to hormone therapy, quality of life, and other additional factors that might impact the effectiveness of the intervention.
      - We aim to start recruitment to the RCT in January 2024. Recruitment will take place over two years. If you are a health professional at a site that delivers breast cancer care and would be interested in your site taking part, please contact the SWEET team to find out more on sweetstudy@newcastle.ac.uk.
      - If you are a patient interested in taking part, please contact your hospital to see if they are taking part in the study, and whether you are eligible to take part.

  - name: Health economic evaluation
    title: Workstream 4
    description: Workstream 4 will include i) analyses to establish the cost-effectiveness of the intervention within the context of the RCT (Workstream 3), ii) a budget impact analysis, and iii) modelling of long-term cost-effectiveness for the recommended 5-10+ year period of hormone therapy treatment.

  - name: Pathway to impact and potential scale-up to NHS implementation
    title: Workstream 5
    description:
      - Workstream 5 will inform potential implementation and scale up across the NHS. We will be using findings from discussions and interviews with healthcare professionals conducted during Workstreams 1, 2 and 3, to guide this. In particular, we will identify ‘functions’ that are most important to delivery and how other contextual factors that influence delivery can maximise potential impact for patients, and others involved throughout the programme.
      - To scale up impact beyond the programme, we will i) form close working relationships with charities, the NHS and commissioning bodies, ii) link with the NHS Long Term Plan, and iii) engage with the NIHR Digital Strategy.
