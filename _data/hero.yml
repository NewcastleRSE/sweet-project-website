# If you want to send the user to a different section, click on the section using the navigation bar at the top and make a note of what the url is that is added on after the base domain name. If you want to change this button to go to the team section instead then sendTo would be '#/team' because the url would be something like 'www.sweet.com/#team' after clicking on the team button. You can replicate this for the other sections also.
