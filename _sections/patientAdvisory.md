Our patient advisory group (also known as the PAG) is made up of 13 women who have been prescribed hormone therapy for breast cancer. They have been, and continue to be, actively involved throughout the research programme, including developing design and content of the intervention, testing usability, advising on patient-facing materials, reviewing questionnaires, reviewing emerging findings, and contributing to dissemination. We also set up a Community of Interest, a group of 28 women who have previously had breast cancer and have been prescribed hormone therapy. They advise us on an ad hoc basis, via email, on a range of topics such as real-life hints and tips for dealing with side-effects, for inclusion on the HT&Me website.
