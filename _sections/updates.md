This page will provide updates on progress with the SWEET research programme.

## Trial updates

Data collection for our Feasibility study is now complete.

A total of 59 women have been recruited to sub-study 1 investigating the acceptability and feasibility of delivering the SWEET support package across our 5 sites:

- Gateshead Health NHS Foundation Trust
- Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust
- Imperial College Hospital Trust
- Newcastle-upon-Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust
- Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust

We have also recruited a total of 56 women to sub-study 2, testing the processes for collecting prescription encashment data.

  Lay summary:

  The HT&Me intervention was created to help women with ER+ breast cancer take their hormone therapy, and also improve their overall quality of life. It was created with involvement and input from lots of people with varied backgrounds – including women with breast cancer, researchers and medical experts. HT&Me includes appointments with a trained nurse, a short video, the HT&Me website, and motivational text/email messages to help women to manage their treatment. We tested this with a small number of women taking hormone therapy for their breast cancer and made improvements based on feedback to make sure that HT&Me is practical and acceptable. We are testing the HT&Me intervention in future larger studies to see if it works well and is cost effective.

  Lay summary:

  To develop interventions to support women to take their hormone therapy, our research aimed to identify the reasons women may not take their hormone therapy as prescribed. Women aged over 18 years, with a diagnosis of ER+ breast cancer who were prescribed hormone therapy were invited to complete a questionnaire. The questionnaire measured; (i) key social and demographic factors; (ii) possible reasons non-adherence and; (iii) non-adherence to hormone therapy. Women who said they regularly missed doses or who had stopped taking hormone therapy were classified as non-adherent. 1,606 women completed the questionnaire. 395 women (25%) were classified as non-adherent. Feeling that hormone therapy may disrupt your lifestyle, activities and interests was linked to being less likely to believe that taking hormone therapy is necessary and being more likely to expect negative outcomes, leading to non-adherence. Women who reported they were informed about why they were taking AET, how it works, their risk of side-effects and what to do if they experienced side-effects, were more likely to believe taking hormone therapy is necessary for them, have better use of coping skills and greater adherence. Women without a medication taking routine and who did not perceive their hormone therapy to be necessary/important were more likely to forget to take it.
