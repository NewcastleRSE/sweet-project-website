Logging into the HT&Me website is only possible for women and clinicians taking part in the SWEET study. If you have a login for HT&Me, you can login by clicking on the button below.

If you are interested in becoming involved, you can contact the SWEET research team by emailing sweetstudy@newcastle.ac.uk.

For those unable to login and those who are not taking part in the study, here is a screenshot of the HT&Me homepage to give an example of what it looks like.

There are 4 key information-based sections (in purple) which provide information, hints and tips and videos and experiences from other women with breast cancer on: i) what hormone therapy is and how it works, ii) managing side-effects, iii) healthy living, and iv) getting support from others.

There are also 4 interactive sections (in yellow) where users can log their own experiences and challenges with taking hormone therapy to help them to get the most out of the HT&Me website, by tailoring it to their needs.
