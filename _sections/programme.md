The SWEET research programme will develop and investigate the effectiveness of a support package (HT&Me) to support adherence to hormone therapy and improve quality of life for women with early breast cancer.

The HT&Me support package includes:

- A short animation video explaining how hormone therapy works, why it is important to take daily, and advice for managing side-effects
- Two appointments with HT&Me Study Nurses
- Access to the interactive HT&Me website, accessible on desktop computer, laptop computer, tablet or mobile phone
- Regular text or email messages reminding of the importance of hormone therapy and signposting back to the HT&Me website
