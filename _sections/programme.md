The SWEET research programme will develop and investigate the effectiveness of a blended intervention (HT&Me) to support adherence to hormone therapy and improve quality of life for women with early breast cancer.

The intervention includes:

- A short animation video providing information on how hormone therapy works, why it is important to take daily, and advice for managing side-effects
- Two appointments with HT&Me study nurses
- Access to the interactive HT&Me website
- Regular text/email messages reminding of the importance of hormone therapy and signposting back to the HT&Me website
