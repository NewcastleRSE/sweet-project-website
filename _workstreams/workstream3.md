Workstream 3 involves the delivery of a randomised control trial (RCT) alongside a process evaluation.
We are investigating whether the HT&Me support package improves adherence to hormone therapy and cancer-specific health-related quality of life. To do this, a total of 1460 women with early breast cancer will be randomised to receive i) either the HT&Me support package alongside their usual care, or ii) usual care alone. Women will be asked to complete questionnaires when they sign up to the study (baseline), and then 6, 12 and 18-months later. These will measure their adherence to hormone therapy, quality of life, and other additional factors that might impact the effectiveness of the HT&Me support package.

Recruitment opened in January 2024, and will take place over two years.
