Workstream 3 will deliver a randomised control trial (RCT) with a parallel process evaluation. A total of 1460 eligible women will be randomised to receive either the HT&Me intervention alongside usual care, or usual care alone. We are investigating whether the HT&Me intervention improves adherence to hormone therapy and cancer-specific health-related quality of life. Women will be asked to complete questionnaires 6, 12 and 18-months after they have been randomised in the study, measuring their adherence to hormone therapy, quality of life, and other additional factors that might impact the effectiveness of the intervention.

We aim to start recruitment to the RCT in January 2024. Recruitment will take place over two years. If you are a health professional at a site that delivers breast cancer care and would be interested in your site taking part, please [click here](/#contact) to find out more.

If you are a patient interested in taking part, please contact your hospital to see if they are taking part in the study, and whether you are eligible to take part.
