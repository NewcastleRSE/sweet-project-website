Workstream 2 assesses the feasibility of the HT&Me support package for both users and healthcare professionals, across two sub-studies. To do this, we have recruited 59 women who had been prescribed hormone therapy for early breast cancer across 5 NHS sites in England to our first sub-study. Women received the HT&Me support package for 8 weeks alongside their usual care and completed a questionnaire before they received the support package, and then a second one 8 weeks later. We interviewed 20 of these women to hear about their experiences of the HT&Me support package. We also interviewed 13 of the key healthcare professionals that were involved in delivering the support package across our sites to gather feedback on the study processes. Data has been useful to inform the randomised control trial (RCT) (Workstream 3).

In a second sub-study, where 56 women were recruited, we have tested the feasibility of accessing, and analysing, prescription encashment and GP prescribing data to objectively measure adherence to hormone therapy.

We have recruited women from the following sites:

- Gateshead Health NHS Foundation Trust
- Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust
- Imperial College Hospital Trust
- Newcastle-upon-Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust
- Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust
