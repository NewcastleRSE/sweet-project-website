Workstream 2 used both quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the HT&Me intervention, and the future randomised controlled trial (Workstream 3). To do this, we have recruited 59 women prescribed hormone therapy for early breast cancer across 5 NHS sites in England to receive the HT&Me intervention for 8 weeks alongside their usual care. Women were asked to complete a questionnaire before they receive the intervention, and then another 8 weeks later.

We have also tested the feasibility of accessing, and using, both prescription encashment and GP prescribing data to objectively measure adherence to hormone therapy.

We have recruited women from the following sites:

- Newcastle-upon-Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust
- Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust
- Imperial College Hospital Trust
- Gateshead Health NHS Foundation Trust
- Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.
