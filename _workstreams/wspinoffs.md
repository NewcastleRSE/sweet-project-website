1. QUIETER+ Inequalities in adherence to endocrine therapy in women with ER+ve breast cancer: can these explain disparities in survival?  
Background
In the UK, women with breast cancer living in more deprived areas, and Black women, have shorter survival. We don’t understand why. One reason could be differences in treatments between different groups of women.
Endocrine therapy (ET) is recommended after surgery for oestrogen-receptor positive (ER+ve) breast cancer. By controlling levels of the hormone oestrogen in the body, it reduces the risk of breast cancer coming back (recurrence) and of dying. It is taken as one tablet every day, for at least 5 years. However, up to half of women regularly miss ET tablets (accidentally or deliberately) or stop taking ET completely. This increases their chance of dying from breast cancer.
Studies in other countries suggest women from deprived communities and Black women are more likely to miss or stop their ET. We think this may be an important contributing factor to the shorter survival seen in these groups of women.
Aims
First, we will investigate if there are differences in the amount of ET women with breast cancer in the UK (known as “adherence”) according to where they live (deprived areas vs. affluent areas) and their ethnicity. Second, we will find out whether differences in the amount of ET taken can explain differences in survival by deprivation and ethnicity.
Methods
We will use data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, a collection of people’s GP records. This will be “linked” to other NHS datasets to find out who developed cancer, and who died and when. Our study will include around 35,000 women with breast cancer, diagnosed January 2005-December 2019, who had at least one ET prescription after surgery. For each woman we will look at her prescriptions to work out whether she (1) continued, or stopped, taking ET and (2) missed ET tablets; these two things measure adherence. We will compare adherence across deprivation and ethnic groups. We will examine whether adherence is related to cancer recurrence and survival. Then, we will investigate how women’s deprivation level, ethnic group, adherence and survival are related – whether differences in adherence between groups can explain differences in survival. 
Potential impact 
This project will help understand where action is needed to reduce survival differences. For example, if we show that lower ET adherence is a reason why more deprived and ethnic minority women have lower survival, this will mean these groups might benefit from more support with taking ET. This could help improve breast cancer survival, benefiting patients and the NHS.
