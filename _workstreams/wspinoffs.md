**1. SWEET-PLUS: Supporting adherence to adjuvant CDK4/6 inhibitors in women with early breast cancer**
<br>
#### **Background**
Breast cancer is the commonest cancer in UK women. While many women are diagnosed with early-stage disease, meaning the cancer hasn’t spread, there is still a risk the cancer could come back (recur), even after successful hospital treatment. For women whose cancers are sensitive to the hormone oestrogen, doctors recommend hormone therapy for 5-10 years after hospital treatment to reduce the chance of recurrence.  
New drugs – called CDK4/6 inhibitors - are now being used alongside hormone therapy to further reduce the chance of the cancer coming back. However, studies have shown that many women stop taking these drugs before the two or three year recommended treatment period. Not following the treatment plan could mean the drugs don’t work as well. To get full benefit of these new drugs, women should be supported to take them as recommended, wherever possible.    
#### **Aims**
This SWEET-PLUS project will understand what helps, and what makes it difficult, for women with early breast cancer, who are prescribed CDK4/6 inhibitors, to keep taking them as recommended. Using this information, we will create a support tool, in collaboration with patients, that will help women take their treatment as recommended. 
#### **Design and methods** 
SWEET-PLUS will have three phases:
Phase 1: We will interview around 25 women with early breast cancer who use or have used CDK4/6 inhibitors to learn about their experiences. This will help us understand what challenges they face, how they feel about taking the drug every day, and what might help them stick to the treatment plan.  
Phase 2: We will also hold focus groups with around 20 healthcare professionals, including doctors and nurses, to understand how they prescribe CDK4/6 inhibitors and what advice they give women about continuing or stopping early. 
Phase 3: Using insights from women and healthcare professionals, we will work together to develop a support tool to help women take their CDK4/6 inhibitor as recommended. This will be an addition to our existing HT&Me support package which we developed to help women stay on hormone therapy. We will look for more funding to test the new tool. 
#### **Public & Patient Involvement**
Women with breast cancer and experience of CDK4/6 inhibitors have been involved in developing the project and will continue to play a key role throughout. They will help design patient materials, advise on recruitment, review results, and co-develop the support tool.
#### **Impact and Dissemination**
Our support tool will help women take their treatment as recommended, which will ultimately reduce the chances of the cancer returning and improve survival rates. This will benefit patients, their families, and the NHS. We will share results in papers, briefings and infographics and work with charities and other organisations to ensure they are used to benefit patients.

**2. QUIETER+ Inequalities in adherence to endocrine therapy in women with ER+ve breast cancer: can these explain disparities in survival?**
<br>
#### **Background**
In the UK, women with breast cancer living in more deprived areas, and Black women, have shorter survival. We don’t understand why. One reason could be differences in treatments between different groups of women.
Endocrine therapy (ET) is recommended after surgery for oestrogen-receptor positive (ER+ve) breast cancer. By controlling levels of the hormone oestrogen in the body, it reduces the risk of breast cancer coming back (recurrence) and of dying. It is taken as one tablet every day, for at least 5 years. However, up to half of women regularly miss ET tablets (accidentally or deliberately) or stop taking ET completely. This increases their chance of dying from breast cancer.
Studies in other countries suggest women from deprived communities and Black women are more likely to miss or stop their ET. We think this may be an important contributing factor to the shorter survival seen in these groups of women.
#### **Aims**
First, we will investigate if there are differences in the amount of ET women with breast cancer in the UK (known as “adherence”) according to where they live (deprived areas vs. affluent areas) and their ethnicity. Second, we will find out whether differences in the amount of ET taken can explain differences in survival by deprivation and ethnicity.
#### **Methods**
We will use data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, a collection of people’s GP records. This will be “linked” to other NHS datasets to find out who developed cancer, and who died and when. Our study will include around 35,000 women with breast cancer, diagnosed January 2005-December 2019, who had at least one ET prescription after surgery. For each woman we will look at her prescriptions to work out whether she (1) continued, or stopped, taking ET and (2) missed ET tablets; these two things measure adherence. We will compare adherence across deprivation and ethnic groups. We will examine whether adherence is related to cancer recurrence and survival. Then, we will investigate how women’s deprivation level, ethnic group, adherence and survival are related – whether differences in adherence between groups can explain differences in survival. 
#### **Potential impact**
This project will help understand where action is needed to reduce survival differences. For example, if we show that lower ET adherence is a reason why more deprived and ethnic minority women have lower survival, this will mean these groups might benefit from more support with taking ET. This could help improve breast cancer survival, benefiting patients and the NHS.
