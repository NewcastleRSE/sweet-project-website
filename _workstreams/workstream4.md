Workstream 4 includes: i) analyses to establish how cost-effective the support package is within the context of the randomised control trial (RCT) (Workstream 3), ii) a budget impact analysis, and iii) modelling of long-term cost-effectiveness for the recommended 5-10+ year period of hormone therapy treatment.
<br>
Cost-effectiveness is likely to be influenced by variables including the extent to which the support package increases adherence to hormone therapy, patient age, disease stage, and adherence. The impact of these with other variables will be explored in sensitivity and subgroup analyses.
