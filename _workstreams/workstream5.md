Workstream 5 will inform potential implementation and scale up across the NHS. We will be using findings from discussions and interviews with healthcare professionals conducted during Workstreams 1, 2 and 3, to guide this. In particular, we will identify ‘functions’ that are most important to delivery and how other contextual factors that influence delivery can maximise potential impact for patients, and others involved throughout the programme.

To scale up impact beyond the programme, we will i) form close working relationships with charities, the NHS and commissioning bodies, ii) link with the NHS Long Term Plan, and iii) engage with the NIHR Digital Strategy.
