Workstream 5 seeks to inform the potential implementation of HT&Me within the NHS. We will be using findings from our discussions and interviews with healthcare professionals conducted during Workstreams 1, 2 and 3, to guide this. In particular, we will identify the factors that are most important to delivery and how we can maximise the potential impact for patients, and others involved throughout the programme.
<br>
To scale up our impact beyond the research programme, we will i) form close working relationships with charities, the NHS and commissioning bodies, ii) link with the NHS Long Term Plan, and iii) engage with the NIHR Digital Strategy.
