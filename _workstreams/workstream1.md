Workstream 1 involved the design, development and optimisation of the HT&Me support package. It was developed using an evidence-based and theory-informed approach. Patient and public involvement (PPI) has been integral to all stages of design and development.

Within this workstream we conducted two optimisation studies to collect user feedback. This informed improvements to the HT&Me support package. Preliminary data suggests the HT&Me support package is acceptable and engaging to users.

The diagram below provides an overview of the support package development, design and optimisation process.
