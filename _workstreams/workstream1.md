Workstream 1 involved the design, development and optimisation of the HT&Me intervention. It was developed using an evidence-based and theory-informed approach with patient and public involvement (PPI) integral to all stages of design and development.

We conducted two optimisation sub-studies to collect feedback from users. Changes were made to improve the HT&Me intervention as a result of these. Preliminary data suggests the HT&Me intervention is acceptable and engaging to users. Workstream 1 is complete.
