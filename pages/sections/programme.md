 Sites are open for trial recruitment across the UK.  We are seeking to recruit a total of 1460 women with early breast cancer, who will be randomised to receive either:
 
 i) the HT&Me support package alongside their usual care
 
 or
 
ii) usual care alone

Women will be asked to complete a questionnaire when they sign up to the study (baseline), and then again 6,12 and 18-months later.  These questionnaires will measure adherence to hormone therapy, quality of life, and other factors that might impact the effectiveness of the HT&Me support package.

We are also conducting a cost-effectiveness evaluation and developing a scale-up implementation strategy- to read about these click here.
