There are 4 key information-based sections (in purple) which provide information, hints and tips and videos and experiences from other women with breast cancer, as well as links to reputable external sites that may be of additional use : i) what hormone therapy is and how it works, ii) managing side-effects, iii) how to support healthy living and a healthy mind, and iv) getting support from others.

There are also 3 interactive sections (in yellow) where users can log their own experiences and challenges with taking hormone therapy to help them to get the most out of the HT&Me website, by tailoring it to their needs, set up reminders for taking medication and ordering and collecting prescriptions, making plans and setting goals and an interactive side effect diary.
